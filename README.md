Minecraft Bukkit Plugin to add Glyphs RPG mechanic to the Game

# Functionality
Glyphs are items that drop from a variety of sources ranging from blocks to mobs (configurable).  Glyphs have a rarity, an element (to be gone over later), a level, and attributes.

Each player will be able to access a "Glyph Inventory" by right clicking on an enchanting table (can be configured) or by executing a command (if they are allowed.)  The glyph inventory will need slots to be unlocked before a player can place glyphs in it.  This uses vanilla levels with each additional slot costing an additional level making it more difficult to unlock every slot.

They will then be able to drop glyphs into the inventory which will then give the character the benefits the glyphs list as well as allow the player to level the glyphs by performing various different actions for different types of experience.  Glyph's attributes give multiple different benefits ranging from simple durability use reduction to the ability to chain break blocks.
